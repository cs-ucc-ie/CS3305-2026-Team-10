# Player

The player GameObject acts as the primary controller for the user. It integrates three core functional scripts:

TODO input should be moved into input manager

- [`Movement.cs`](../Assets/Scripts/Items/Item.cs): Handles keyboard-based locomotion.

- Look: Manages mouse-driven camera rotation.

- Interaction: Performs raycasting to detect and trigger interactable objects in the world."
