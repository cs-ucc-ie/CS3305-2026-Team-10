# Player

The player GameObject acts as the primary controller for the user. It integrates three core functional scripts.

## KeyboardMovement

See [`KeyboardMovement.cs`](../Assets/Scripts/Player/KeyboardMovement.cs)

Keyboard movement input is read from [`InputManager`](./InputManager.md).

`KeyboardMovement` handles player character controller movement, as well as giving an fake -9.8f gravity.

## MouseLook

See [`MouseLook.cs`](../Assets/Scripts/Player/MouseLook.cs)

Mouse movement input is read from [`InputManager`](./InputManager.md).

This script handles the mouse look functionality for a first-person camera.

It rotates the camera and player based on mouse movement.

Remember: X axis is bind on player, Y axis is bind on camera.

## CheckInteractable

See [`CheckInteractable.cs`](../Assets/Scripts/Player/CheckInteractable.cs)

Performs raycasting to detect and trigger interactable objects in the world.

When [`InputManager`](./InputManager.md) invoke an `OnInteractPressed` event, `CheckInteractable` will perform a raycasting to detect and trigger [`InteractableObject.md`](./InteractableObject.md) in the world.
